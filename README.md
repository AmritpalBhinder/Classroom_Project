* 📝 **CRUD Operations** – Add, update, delete, and view data dynamically
* 🔄 **Global Store** – Share state seamlessly across components
* 🎨 **Responsive UI** – Built with modern design practices
* 🧩 **Reusable Components** – Clean and maintainable code structure

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React.js (Functional Components, Hooks)
* **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
* **Styling**: CSS / Tailwind / Bootstrap (whichever you used)
* **Other**: (Axios, JSON-server, React Router, etc. if used)
